# node-tcp
Trying to use stockmopar's excellent [Connected by TCP Node.js Control](https://github.com/stockmopar/connectedbytcp) to turn my TCP lights on and off.

In combination with [ha-bridge from bwssytems](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge) I hope to be able to use Alexa to turn the lights on, off and to dim them.
